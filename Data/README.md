This Folder is to store your costum dataset.

The Pipeline expects each metatranscriptomic sequencing file to be added in its own directory.
The sub-directory preferably is named after the sequencing file.

Example: SRR12345.fastq ; Data/SRR12345/SRR12345.fastq.gz 

The results of quality assurance checks done by the pipeline are stored in the individual directories of the sequencing files.
This because they apply to only that file and allows for easy retrieval when investigating a single result/Outlier.
